# Cosmolog
Cosmolog (c)2017-2019 Richard E. Knouse.
This is a Visual Studio 2017 C# solution.
It was used to generate the physical quantities and list of formulas used in Orest Bedrij's three volume set:
"'1' The Encyclopedia of Physical Laws." The entire list was marshalled through the MS Word libary to produce
a series of MS Word files, ready for publication.
